# 🚀 Getting started with Strapi

Strapi comes with a full featured [Command Line Interface](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/cli) (CLI) which lets you scaffold and manage your project in seconds.

### Install

Install with `npm install`

### `develop`

Before running it for the first time, make sure you have
- postgres running locally
- a copy of our `.env` file (tweak postgres credentials to match your own)
- run `npm run build` as this compiles with the env vars. 

Once this is done, you can run

```
npm run dev
```

You'll need to create an account locally to explore this locally. Bear in mind that each time you pull down from any remote branch and there are changes to schema/structure (why else would you pull down), you'll need to review your Public & Authenticated Role Permissions along with your user Role permissions for each content type (collection, single type, media, etc.)

Ideally, this needs to be in sync with what the team follows across environments.
